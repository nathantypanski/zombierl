zombierl
========

A simple python-based zombie roguelike.

All the content is stored in `zombie.py`, the rest is just library files.

It is written in Python 3 and you can load it simply by changing to the directory and running it.

This is still in a very alpha/testing/unstable development stage, so I don't list the keybindings here or do anything else nice for you if you want to play it. Sorry!
